# Crash Bash

Crash Bash is being migrated to one native/Lightrec hybrid over the authenticated USA PlayStation
release. The title retains its cohesive native boot, device, rendering, input, widescreen, and
interpolation owners. Every other guest path will execute through psxport's per-`Core` Lightrec
runtime.

The old offline translator integration, generated guest corpus, static dispatcher/registry, seed
configuration, static-only verifiers, build tree, and static product binaries were deleted before
dynarec implementation. They are not a bridge, fallback, or oracle.

The native title adapter now authenticates and loads the resident executable, installs the 27
image-qualified native owners, and composes the retained frame and interpolation presenters. Its 15
original-body calls enter psxport's generation-aware dispatcher and scoped original-call boundary.

`crashbash_port` is now a real executable entry: it authenticates the resident image, creates the
per-Core title runtime, binds hardware owners, and enters psxport's native boot/frame loop. A real
resident-image run reaches the measured application initialization chain, then stops at the existing
strict VSync frame-boundary contract in `0x80012E90`; the entry is therefore a verified build and
authentication milestone, not gameplay completion. The next owner must make that startup operation
resumable across a frame boundary or replace the measured CD/application operation with a complete
title-owned equivalent. The VSync trap remains fail-fast.

## Player input and provisioning

The intended default remains `./run.sh`, with an optional explicit USA CHD:

```sh
./run.sh
./run.sh "/path/to/Crash Bash (USA).chd"
```

The launcher currently provisions the authenticated executable and modules, then launches the
player entry. The entry currently stops at the named startup boundary above. It never emits or
compiles guest source. Disc resolution is
explicit argument, `PSXPORT_CRASHBASH_DISC`, `PSXPORT_DISC`, the same keys in `.env`, then one
root-level `.chd`. Original game content remains untracked.

`run.sh` is only a stable root handoff to `uv run --frozen python bootstrap.py`. Python owns
dependency discovery, provisioning, build policy, and launch behavior; it passes the locked
interpreter through to project tools.

## Verification

The canonical asset-free verifier builds the real native title adapter, runs every Crash Bash CTest
(including formatting, clang-tidy, launcher, provisioning, and source-policy contracts), and checks
the linked artifact for retired execution paths:

```sh
CC=clang CXX=clang++ uv run --frozen python tools/verify.py
```

`tools/verify.py` resolves the pinned framework and delegates build/test policy to its shared
`ConsumerVerifier`. Builds use `build/migration/` and the locked Python interpreter. Linux CI consumes
the same framework's pinned setup action and runs this command without any game assets.

The source-policy check reports all 27 registrations and 15 original calls and rejects the retired
translator and dispatch paths. A local real-executable check exercises the same resident loader:

```sh
PSXPORT_CARD=scratch/title-adapter-test/card.mcr uv run --frozen python -c \
  'import subprocess; subprocess.run(["build/migration/crashbash_title_adapter_test", "scratch/bin/crashbash/SCUS_945.70"], check=True)'
```

This authenticates and publishes the resident image; it does not execute retail boot or gameplay.
Historical emulator/binary evidence and bounded replays under `replays/flow/` remain the scenarios for
later dynarec gameplay qualification.

## Product completion

The complete port must prove nonzero translated execution, correct
loaded-image invalidation, bounded VSync/interrupt/exception exits, image-scoped overrides, and a gameplay link without an explicit interpreter mode. Boot, logos, menus, FMV, and a first frame are implementation
checkpoints only. Completion requires representative controllable gameplay with correct rendering,
audio, timing, devices, and frame-time evidence, followed by broader retail-mode coverage.

See `docs/project-goals.md`, `docs/project-state.md`, `docs/codemap.md`, and
`docs/re-frontier.md` for the canonical goal, state, ownership, and evidence boundaries.
