# The migration boundary, counted so it cannot drift silently.
#
# 2026-10-02: 28 -> 29 registrations and 16 -> 17 original calls, for ONE addition — the load-pump
# drain owner on the resident pacing pump 0x8001231C (game/core/cd_file_read.cpp). The shipping
# disc read is synchronous, so the title's one-call-per-frame queue pacing was the load-only wait;
# the owner loops the retail pump to quiescence — the same completion route the retail scene-swap
# path 0x8001E610 already uses — and reads the pump's own three queue words for its drain
# condition, so the single new original-call site is the pump itself.
#
# 2026-09-30: 27 -> 28 registrations and 15 -> 16 original calls, for ONE addition — the read-only
# scene-machine observer on the retail leaf 0x8001E588 (game/diagnostics/scene_machine.cpp). It was
# added because the mode question was being read from a word with exactly one writer, so "reached
# Crashball" and "never left the logo" printed the same line; see docs/issues/0032. Each increment has
# to name itself here, because a tripwire that is relaxed without a reason is the same defect as one
# that is never relaxed.
